This project implements a **temperature monitoring system** using Arduino in an embedded system. The system measures the ambient temperature using a sensor (e.g., LM35 or DHT11) and displays the readings on an LCD or Serial Monitor. This project is simulated in **TinkerCAD**, allowing users to visualize the circuit and its functionality.

## Features
- **Temperature Measurement**: Reads the ambient temperature in real-time.
- **Visual Display**: Displays the temperature on an LCD or Serial Monitor.
- **Easy-to-Simulate**: Fully designed and simulated in TinkerCAD for educational and prototyping purposes.

## Requirements
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino Uno
- **Temperature Sensor**: LM35, DHT11, or equivalent
- **Display Module**: 16x2 LCD or Serial Monitor
- Breadboard, resistors, and jumper wires
- Simulation tool: [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/)

## How It Works
1. **Temperature Sensing**:
   - The temperature sensor (e.g., LM35) reads the ambient temperature and sends an analog or digital signal to the Arduino.
2. **Data Processing**:
   - The Arduino processes the sensor data and converts it into readable temperature values (in °C or °F).
3. **Display**:
   - The temperature is displayed on a connected 16x2 LCD or printed on the Serial Monitor.
     
## Applications
- **Home Automation**: Monitoring room temperature for HVAC systems.
- **Industrial Use**: Tracking temperature in machinery for safety.
- **Educational**: Learning embedded systems and sensor interfacing.
